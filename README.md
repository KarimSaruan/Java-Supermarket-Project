# Java-Supermarket-Project
This is a project I did in university. It's a supermarket software.
It consists of several classes and uses threads so the cash registers
can work parallel. Exceptions are also used, for instance when the amount
of a certain stock in the store is insufficient an exception will be thrown.
A text file is created for each of the receipts.
